# AI-Powered Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of an AI-powered recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform, providing personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchase history.

## Project Structure

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for data collection and preprocessing.
- `recommendation_model.py`: Script for building the recommendation model.
- `app.py`: Flask application to serve the recommendation engine API.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Script for evaluating the recommendation engine.
- `data/IMDB_Top250_Tvshows.csv`: Dataset used for the project.
- `data/preprocessed_data.csv`: Preprocessed dataset.


## Setup Instructions

**Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/satyamp03/RecommendationEngine.git
   cd RecommendationEngine
```

### Requirements

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Gathered and preprocessed the necessary data (IMDB Top 250 TV Shows dataset).
   - Handled missing data and scaled features for consistent input to the model.

2. **Model Development**
   - Implemented a collaborative filtering model using cosine similarity to generate personalized product recommendations.

3. **Scalability and Performance**
   - Ensured the recommendation engine can handle high traffic and provide low-latency responses by precomputing similarity matrices and using efficient vectorized operations.

4. **Evaluation and Optimization**
   - Implemented a mechanism to continuously evaluate the performance of the recommendation engine using precision and recall metrics.
   - Demonstrated a detailed debugging process to align recommendations with expected outputs.

### How to Run

1. **Set up the environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas scikit-learn flask
     ```

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Place the `IMDB_Top250_Tvshows.csv` file in the `data` directory.
   - Run the data preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python data_preprocessing.py
     ```

3. **Model Development:**
   - Run the recommendation model script to generate recommendations:
     ```bash
     python recommendation_model.py
     ```

4. **API for Recommendations:**
   - Run the Flask app to serve the recommendation engine:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Access the API to get recommendations:
     ```
     http://localhost:5000/recommend?index=0&num=5
     ```
     - `index`: Index of the show in the dataset to base recommendations on.
     - `num`: Number of recommendations to retrieve (default is 5).

5. **Evaluation and Optimization:**
   - Evaluate the model using the evaluation script:
     ```bash
     python evaluate_model.py
     ```

### Files

- **data_preprocessing.py:** Script for preprocessing the raw dataset.
- **recommendation_model.py:** Script for developing the recommendation model.
- **app.py:** Flask app to serve the recommendation engine as an API.
- **evaluate_model.py:** Script for evaluating the recommendation model.
- **data/IMDB_Top250_Tvshows.csv:** Raw dataset (to be placed in the `data` directory).
- **data/preprocessed_data.csv:** Preprocessed dataset (generated by `data_preprocessing.py`).

### Evaluation Results †

- **Precision:** 0
- **Recall:** 0

### Future Improvements

- Improve data preprocessing to handle edge cases and more complex scenarios.
- Implement advanced recommendation algorithms such as hybrid models combining collaborative and content-based filtering.
- Optimize the evaluation strategy to better capture the performance and accuracy of the recommendations.


† The precision and recall were zero because the relevant items for each test index were not found in the recommendations. Perhaps including more informative features and using a different similarity metric would help in the future.
